I worked on a consulting project for EatSleepRide, a phone app for motorcycle riders.  I was tasked with labeling their phone data from riders.  Currenlty, the company has employees manually labeling this data it takes one employee 8 hours to label 30-60 minutes of riding data.  The goal is to use this label data to create new models and features for their app.  I can not post the data set or my entire code.  I'm waiting for the go-ahead to post a portion of my code as an example of my coding experience.
